    "    - Perform more complex mathematical calculations than basic arithmetic (math module in the standard library)\n",

    "    - Handle matrices (numpy package in external libraries)\n",
    "    - Perform data analysis and machine learning (scikit-learn package in external libraries)\n",
    "- In the field of data science, including machine learning and deep learning, Python has become almost a de facto standard\n",
    "- Relatively easy to learn\n",
    "- Abundant resources are available"
